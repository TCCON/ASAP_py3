Python and BrukerPy Installation Guide

Part 1: Installing Python 

Insert BrukerPy USB stick or access scratch/geddesag and navigate to the Python_and_BrukerPy folder

Determine Computer OS
Click Start, right click computer, properties, determine if 32bit or 64 bit

Copy the python folder with the associated 32 or 64 bit version from Python_and_BrukerPy  to the desktop
Enter the folder on the desktop and extract the zipped anaconda file

From the newly unzipped folder, run the only file contained within (anaconda appliation)
Select installation users (shouldnt matter, all is preferable)
Select installation path, preferably at the root of the C drive
tick both boxes, crucially the path variable
click install and wait (10 mins)

Check that python / anaconda has been installed
Find Anaconda in the start menu and run spyder
This may take a short while to load up the first time
Play in the ipython console, check that its working, import numpy etc

Part 2: Install Pyephem
From anaconda in the start menu open the anaconda prompt
Navigate to the python desktop folder
enter the following command;
pip install <ephem wheel file> 
where <ephem wheel file is the name of the wheel file in the folder, in the 32 bit case this command would be;
pip install ephem-3.7.6.0-cp27-none-win32.whl
This will now install the pyephem library
Check that this is available by typing import ephem in spyder or a python terminal

Part 3: Set up BrukerPy
From the Python_and_BrukerPy , copy the brukerpy folder to your directory of choice, again ideally C:/
open the brukerpy configuration file in the newly created directory
Amend the path and site variables according to your system
Open Spyder and open brukerpy_main.py
Comment out the following lines;
sys.stdout= open("C:/brukerpy_v1.5/run_log.dat","a")
sys.stderr=sys.stdout
This allows us to debug far easier in case its not working
Run the program to test then uncomment the above lines.
Change the run_log directory in the above line to your desired path. This will not change with the configuration file as it is fundamentally hard coded. It is therefore important to change it and know where it points to

Part 4: Set up the all shortcut
On the desktop right click -> new -> shortcut
At the prompt, browse to and select brukerpy_main.py from your brukerpy folder
At the next promt, give the shortcut an appropriate name
Right click on the shortcut -> properties -> shortcut tab -> Change Icon...
Browse to and select the icon file from the brukerpy folder, click ok, and apply
Once again in the shortcut tab, in the Target path enter your python installation directory with pythonw.exe instead of python.exe (it is also sufficient if your python path variable has been set up correctly just to enter pythonw or python) i.e.;
C:\Users\geddesag\AppData\Local\Continuum\Anaconda2\pythonw.exe C:\Users\geddesag\Desktop\brukerpy_v1.5\brukerpy_main.py
this is the same as in the command line entering python brukerpy_main.py
Click ok to close the window and double click on the shortcut
Brukerpy should now start 

BrukerPy Installation should now be complete. Enjoy! Just remember to set up your paths, tasks and schedules according to what you want! If it doesnt work, default back to autobruk or brukerlite and get in touch
