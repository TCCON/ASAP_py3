Python3 port of asap, to be tested and developed 

To do; 

run through 2to3, might be a few stragglers to resolve

check and run on new laptop

Any new features? maybe remove the side bar of tasks and use the plot function that I have for jypy etc. I like the idea of the start time and end time linked as a line against the sza
